A ChatGPT-like web interface where **all inference runs in the user's browser via WebGPU**. No cloud GPUs, no API keys, no limits, no installs.

### How it works

- Runs entirely in the user's browser using [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/).
- **17 models** — latest versions from each family, plus specialists.
- Uses the user's GPU via WebGPU. Requires a compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based).

### Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Llama 3.2 3B** | General purpose (default) |
| **Llama 3.1 8B** | Strong general chat |
| **Hermes 3 3B** | Creative, less filtered |
| **Qwen 3 4B / 8B** | Smart reasoning |
| **Phi 3.5 Mini** | Efficient 3.8B |
| **Mistral 7B v0.3** | Strong instruct |
| **Gemma 2 2B / 9B** | Google models |
| **SmolLM2 360M / 1.7B** | Tiny, low VRAM |
| **Phi 3.5 Vision** | Understands images (camera button) |
| **DeepSeek R1 Qwen 7B** | Reasoning specialist |
| **Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B** | Coding specialist |
| **Qwen 2.5 Math 1.5B** | Math specialist |
| **Ministral 3 3B** | Mistral compact |

**Video & audio**: WebLLM currently supports only **text** and **image** (vision) inputs. Video and audio models are not available in-browser yet. Phi 3.5 Vision is the only multimodal option — you can attach images and ask questions about them.

## Development

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in a WebGPU-capable browser (Chrome, Edge, or other Chromium-based).

## Deployment

Hosted on GitHub Pages. Every push to `master` triggers an automatic build and deploy via GitHub Actions.

## Notes

- The first time a user opens the app, WebLLM will **download the model weights** in the background (a few GB). Subsequent loads are much faster thanks to caching.
- All prompts and responses stay in the browser. Nothing is sent to any server.
